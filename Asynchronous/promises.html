            Promises- 
            - Handle asynchronous code
            - Can be used to avoid callback hell scenario
            - Two properties - state and result (result only in case of resolve/rejected)

            Promises States-
            1. Pending
            2. Resolved (Fullfilled)
            3. Rejected

            2 Ways: 
            Pending -> Resolved -> Settled
            Pending -> Rejected -> Settled
        */

        /*
            - If .then has two callbacks - first callback is for resolve scenario and second callback is for reject scenario
            
            promise.then((resolvedMessage) => {
                console.log('[RESOLVED]' + resolvedMessage)
